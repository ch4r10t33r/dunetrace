"""
Ordered, versioned database migrations — the owner of the shared schema.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Dunetrace's services communicate only through one Postgres
database, which makes the schema the inter-service interface. That interface had
no owner: every service declared the tables it touched with
``CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`` and grew them with ``ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN IF
NOT EXISTS``, so "whichever service starts first wins" was the entire contract.
It worked only because every change so far had been additive, and it already
misfired — ``policies.signature`` was declared by exactly one service while
another service's query selected it inside a try/except that returned an empty
list, so a cold start in the wrong order silently disabled every runtime
guardrail in the fleet.

Additive-only is also a ceiling, not just a risk: changing a primary key across
two services cannot be expressed as start-order-independent idempotent DDL.
That is what forced this module, and the composite ``(org_id, run_id)`` key in
migration 2 is the first change that needed it.

THE RULE. A table touched by more than one service belongs here. A table with a
single owner may stay in that service's own ``ensure_schema`` — the point is
that shared definitions have one home, not that every ``CREATE TABLE`` moves.

HOW IT RUNS. Every service calls ``apply_migrations()`` before its own schema
setup. A Postgres advisory lock serialises concurrent startups, so N replicas
booting together apply each migration exactly once; each migration runs in its
own transaction, so a failure leaves the database at the last good version
rather than half-applied. Services that depend on a specific shape call
``require_schema_version()`` and refuse to start below it, which turns the
old silent-wrong-order failure into a loud one.

This package is on every service's PYTHONPATH and depends only on the driver
connection passed in, so it stays usable from ingest (which does not have the
SDK) as well as from the SDK-carrying services.
